# day-scheduler

## Intro

The entire purpose of this simple yet useful application is to add a little bit of organization throughout the work day. You can start the day with typing out everyting you need to do throughout the day or finish the work day by typing out everything you need to do the next day. All of your typings will be stored localy wether you close the page or not as long as you are loading back in on the same device it will all reappear. Hopefull you find this useful as I know I will likely be using it to keep track of things needing to be done or be able to reference things I've already accomplished.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Day.js

## Sources

CSS and HTML was mostly given from course material to start the challenge.

### JavaScript

- https://day.js.org/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
- youtube videos, tutor session, course material as well as other github users also helped a ton along the way!

## Outro

This simple application was great for getting to learn different ways of using the day.js libraries and other technologies involved. I had fun building this site and look forward to learning and building more and doing similar things with this and other API's as the course continues.
